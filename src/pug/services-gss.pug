                            | How GSS Services Can Help Your Organisation
                        p
                            | Incorporating and establishing a company can sometimes require more time or money than a business plan viably allows for. At times, a business must have feet on the ground in a new foreign market, working towards their interest, without risk or delay.
 
                        p
                            | Global Staffing Solutions (GSS) can help a company to employ full-time employees in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia and other Asian countries, without setting up a local company.  Our GSS clients enjoy the benefits of full-time people working in overseas markets and remaining compliant with local laws, without the time and investment required to set up and operate an overseas legal entity.

                                p Whether your market entry plan’s next step is research and development, the delivery of initial projects, or it simply cannot wait for formal company setup - it is time to consider Global Staffing Solutions (“GSS”) services. 

                                p GSS centers on a core service of offshore hiring, which is the onboarding of a worker in an overseas market and the management of their employment. This includes their salary payments, reimbursements, leave, and regulatory employee declarations and compliance issues. 

                                p This approach helps put feet on the ground quickly.  You receive the benefits of having an employee overseas without the investment costs or hassle normally associated with setting up a company. This also helps to side-step the need to manage complex foreign regulatory employment matters.

                                p As a strategy, this can allow a company to test market entry to one or more Asia countries, and then retain the option to easily scale back, switch to a different country, or upon proven success in a market, to proceed in establishing a formal presence. 

                                p GSS is easy to get into, which means that you need a highly competent partner that you can trust to see it through.
